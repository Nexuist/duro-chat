### Introduction

An anonymous live chat webapp for my [website](https://duro.me) using AWS serverless technologies.

Try it out: https://duro.me/live

For running unit tests, make sure you have [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) and [jest](https://jestjs.io/) installed, and then run `npm test`.

Everything you want to know about the service is detailed in [the article about it](https://duro.me/stories/2019/05/26/updated-live-chat), so I highly recommend reading that through. It should help with understanding the codebase.
